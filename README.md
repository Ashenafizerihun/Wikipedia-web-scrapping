This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a Wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue 
using Python libraries, including BeautifulSoup and Requests.
Specifically, the script extracts information about the largest companies in the United States by revenue, cleans the data, and
stores it in a structured format for further analysis.
